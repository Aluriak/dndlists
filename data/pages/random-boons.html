"An invisible nymph sings to you. Gain a d10 Bardic inspiration die.",
"The water is warm and invigorating. You regain 1d12 hit points every hour.",
"The water sizzles and is mildly acidic. You are resistant to acid damage.",
"The water smells like berries. You are fully fed for the next 24 hours.",
"You feel a sinister presence in the water seep into you. You have advantage on intimidation rolls and are immune to fear. Other people will feel a shiver down their spine, if they look you in the eye.",
"You gain the attention of a denizen of the Feywild. d4 Sprites whom have cast invisibility on themselves follow you around and are friendly towards you.",
"The water's surface is frozen, but feels comfortably warm. You gain resistance to cold damage and you are not negatively effected by cold temperature.",
"The water seems murky, but if you dip your head in it, you can see clearly through it. You have Truesight at a range of 60 feet.",
"You hear mumblings in a foreign language coming from under the water. When you bathe in it, you can understand it. You can speak one random language, you didn't know before.",
"The water emanates a light, warm glow. The glow is transferred to you. Your body emanates dim light in a 15 feet radius.",
"Flower petals are resting on the water's surface. While near living plants, you gain +5 to Wisdom and Constitution saving throws.",
"The water is red. Your melee attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage, if the target is not at its maximum hit points.",
"The water surface remains completely still, even if you bathe in it. You have advantage on saving throws pertaining to fear and charm effects.",
"The water is steaming hot, but it doesn't hurt to enter. You gain an additional hit die for rests and have resistance to fire damage.",
"The water seems shrouded in shadow. You have advantage on stealth checks, and darkvision 60 ft.",
"The water has no visible bottom, and if you fall in, you will continue to sink indefinitely, although it takes only a single round's movement to reach the surface again from any depth. After submerging yourself in the water, the next time you fall from a height of greater than 10 feet you will be under the effect of the Featherfall spell. ",
"The water does not run along a groove in the earth, rather it runs along the surface of the ground while keeping its shape. Drinking some of the water grants advantage on DEX (Acrobatics) checks made to keep balance. ",
"The more you drink, the thirstier you become. Anything you consume over the next 24 hours does not take effect until after the 24 hours are over, at which point you gain the benefits of everything you consumed at once. ",
"The stream tastes botanical and overly sweet, with a bubbly texture. Until your next long rest, you gain advantage on all WIS (Perception) and STR (Athletics) checks, you have advantage on DEX saves, your move speed increases by 10 feet, and if you use an action to make a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to make another melee attack with disadvantage. However, you do not gain any of the benefits of your next long rest, including taking a level of exhaustion. ",
"The spring water tastes of dust and stale air and you find yourself parched after drinking from it. For the next 24 hours you find yourself able to read and understand all languages native to the plane you are in. ",
"The spring feels ice cold although no ice is visible on the surface. Your skin grows completely numb for a short period and after inspection has grown tougher. Your AC is raised by 3 for 24 hours. ",
"The water fills you with a jittery energy and your finger tips and toes tingle constantly for the remainder of the effect. You gain +10 movement speed and require no sleep for the next 24 hours. Although a period of inactivity must be taken to regain rest benefits. ",
"When submerged in the water you gain a vision of your future presented by a hero of times past. It feels as though vision takes hours but to none participants takes only seconds. [May be a vision presented by the DM or a use of the portance spell] ",
"The longer you stare into the water the more distorted your reflection becomes. At first your eyes shift through colours slowly, than your hair, soon every characteristic is changing in a blur. The player at this point can select a complete physical change lasting for the 24 hour period. This is not an illusion but does not effect voice, mannerisms or age. [DMs choice if a minor effect of this is Permanent] ",
"The water looks darker than usual, but feels oddly refreshing. You gain 2d4/2d6 Temporary HP upon drinking it. ",
"The water makes you 10 years younger.",

<li>The water flow is unnaturally slow. Your ranged attacks slow enemies by 10 feet for 1 round.</li>
<li>The water feels unbearably hot, but at the same time, strangely inviting. A character that bathes in the water for a minute feels this heat through their entire body. After this point, they will continue to steam for 2d8 hours after leaving the water, and their skin will be as hot as a red hot iron. During this period, any creature that performs a melee attack against the character within 5 feet takes 1d4 fire damage. All unarmed attacks by the character deal an additional 1d4 fire damage. Drinking or eating anything cold cancels this effect. </li>
<li>The spring has gold coins at its bottom. The gold coins burst into harmless flames and disappear upon leaving the water. Bathing in the water gives you advantage on perception, investigation and survival checks pertaining to dragons or treasure hoarded by dragons. You also gain +10 on persuasion checks against dragons unless they succeed a DC 20 Insight check to notice the effect of the spring on you.</li>
<li>Upon contact with the water you feel oddly tenacious. Every oppressive thought, negative emotion and unhealthy anxiety that was plaguing you disappears as your mind fills with confidence and calm. You gain 2 legendary resistances (for this day only).</li>
<li>The water's reflection acts like a window to another place. Upon contact with the water, you gain the ability to freely scry on a random location (DM's discretion) on this plane of existence or another.</li>
<li>The water is crystal clear and unnaturally refreshing. Drinking it gives you one extra hit die to use at short rests and makes you notice small crevasse and details around you, that you didn't see before. You gain advantage on perception checks and always know the armor class, weaknesses and resistances of a creature you've studied for over 30 seconds.</li>
<li>You can hear very faint, angelic singing under the surface. You have resistance to all damage dealt to you by undead and fiends. You can also read and speak celestial.</li>
<li>The water's surface shimmers and sparkles in a mesmerizing pattern. You can't shake the feeling, that someone is prying into your mind. You gain the ability to summon a flumph as an action. The flumph lasts for a number of minutes equal to your level (doubled if your alignment is lawful good). After that, the flumph poofs out of existence. The flumph is not under your control unless your alignment is lawful good, and it will act friendly towards anyone with a good alignment. You can only summon a flumph this way 3 times per short rest.</li>
<li>Sparkling lights slowly rise from the water. You gain 1d6 random skill proficiencies.</li>
<li>The water tastes foul and stale, but it invigorates you. All poison damage you take now heals you for that amount instead.</li>
<li>Tiny spectral boats float on the surface of the water. Your traveling speed on a mount or vehicle is doubled and you gain advantage on skill checks while you're traveling on sea.</li>
<li>The water is lagoon green and smells like tea. Drinking it makes you acutely aware of your surroundings. You gain advantage on dexterity saving throws and +5 to intelligence checks.</li>
<li>The your reflection in the water is not of you, but of one of your family members. You can cast sending 5 times per short rest to that person.</li>
<li>Drinking from the water fills you with a cozy, sleepy sensation. You can kiss a willing creature on the mouth to put them to sleep for 8 hours. The creature will wake up from anything that would normally wake it up from its sleep (except being well rested). The creature does not have to be aware of the effect, but it has to be willing to kiss.</li>
<li>The water sticks on you like mucus. Whenever you are healed above your maximum hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount healed. This amount can not exceed 3 times your level.</li>
<li>Drinking the water numbs you to the world, and you fall to the ground. After a few seconds, you can get up on your feet again with renewed strength. Whenever you are affected by a condition that would make you incapacitated, you can as a reaction choose to be knocked prone instead. You can however only use this reaction if you're not knocked prone.</li>
<li>Memories of the past seeps into you, if you bathe in or drink the water. You gain advantage on history checks and +1 to all your base attributes.</li>
<li>You can hear a heartbeat coming from the spring. You have advantage on death saving throws.</li>
<li>The water creates small whirlpools in different colors. After you take damage from a spell, you gain resistance to that type of damage until you take damage from a spell again.</li>
<li>The water tastes bitter and vaguely of banana and chocolate. You gain +5 to your strength and advantage on skill checks pertaining to arm wrestling.</li>
<li>A snake made of water crawls out of the spring and nods at you, before it disperses into a puddle. For d4 days, you gain the ability to summon this snake from any source of water. It has the stats of a poisonous snake, is under your control and can squeeze through any opening, that water would be able to travel through. It can disperse into a puddle of water, that will disappear in 10 hours.</li>
<li>Through the splashes in the water, you can faintly hear echoes of the sounds you make yourself, as if captured in the water. You gain the ability to copy any sound you've heard, so long as it hasn't been more than an hour since you heard it last (this includes your own copy of that sound).</li>
<li>Drinking the water fills you with immense power, that tears through your body. Drinking one sip gives you +1 to all your base attributes, but decreases your maximum hit points by 10% (rounded up). You can only be brought back to life with True Resurrection or a Wish spell, if you die by drinking 10 sips of this. After 24 hours, you will gain points of exhaustion dependening on how many sips you took. Additional effects occur on higher amounts of sips. The effects are listed on the below table.</li>
